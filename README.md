# htf-tinker
Development and testing the HybridTopologyFactory from OpenFE to improve dummy-core interactions.


## Goals

- Create a minimal example of using the HybridTopologyFactory (HTF) from OpenFE.
- Test and debug the HTF with simple systems to understand its behavior.
- Explore the interactions between dummy atoms and core atoms in alchemical transformations.
- Document findings and potential issues for future reference.
